# zip-tz-clj

Hackery to convert US zip code to time zone.

This uses zip code [data from the US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html)
and timezone [data from timezone-boundary-builder](https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/releases).

This code may not actually do what I intend it to, but it was just a stab at the problem.

YMMV.
